<h1 align="center"> MLB-Fantasy-App </h1>
<h2 align="center">This was what I decided to do for my VB Final Project. This Win-Forms app is a MLB fantasy league roster-builder, it targets the East divisions
specifically as my college is located on the East Coast. This project is not endorsed by the Major League Baseball organization in way,
nor was this a paid project - this was purely a student project. Please contact me if any images violate some sort of contract.</h2>

<h3 align="center"> How To:</h3>

- Fork the repository
- Download files, and open in Visual Studio. 
- Ensure access database connection, if there is an issue with the established connection
you may need to remove that data source, and redownload the access file from this <a href ="https://github.com/im-zach/MLB-Fantasy-App/blob/master/MLBAllPlayers.mdb">repository directly</a> 
- That is essentially all the program "relies" on.
